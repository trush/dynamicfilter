The Dynamic Filter works at the intersection of human computing and query processing, to make filtering a database using Amazon\textquotesingle{}s Mechanical Turk (A\+MT) more efficient. The Dynamic Filter uses an adaptive approach to address the problem of not knowing filter selectivity and cost {\itshape a} {\itshape priori}, without seeking to directly estimate either metric. The approach is strongly based on the algorithm described in the paper \char`\"{}\+Eddies\+: Continuously Adaptive Query Processing\char`\"{} by Avnur and Hellerstein.\hypertarget{index_gettingstarted}{}\section{Getting Started}\label{index_gettingstarted}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Amazon\textquotesingle{}s}} {\bfseries{Mechanical}} {\bfseries{Turk\+:}} A service provided by Amazon, where workers can use the site to complete Human Intelligence Tasks (H\+I\+Ts) posted by developers/researchers like us.
\item {\bfseries{Human}} {\bfseries{Intelligence}} {\bfseries{Task}} {\bfseries{}}(H\+IT)\+: A task issued on A\+MT to a worker/workers. Typical H\+I\+Ts include identifying what kinds of things are in a photo or transcribing a short audio clip. Workers are compensated with a small monetary reward (money or Amazon store credit).
\item {\bfseries{item\+:}} An entity or object in the database that we are attempting to query. These have qualities that will make them pass or fail predicates.
\item {\bfseries{predicate\+:}} A condition or quality that items in the database may or may not satisfy. (e.\+g. for hotel items, \char`\"{}\+Has a gym\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}\+Costs less than \$80 per night\char`\"{})
\item {\bfseries{IP}} {\bfseries{pair\+:}} An item-\/predicate pair. The combination of an item with some predicate, which will either be \char`\"{}true,\char`\"{} meaning that the item satisfies the predicate, or \char`\"{}false,\char`\"{} meaning the item does not. IP pairs are the content of tasks issued to workers.
\item {\bfseries{task\+:}} A Human Intelligence Task (H\+IT) posted on A\+MT.
\item {\bfseries{selectivity\+:}} The likelihood that a predicate is false for items in the database. Defined (for our purposes) as the ratio of items that fail the predicate to the number of items overall. Thus, high selectivity means that a predicate passes very few items.
\item {\bfseries{ambiguity\+:}} The difficulty of getting consensus about whether items satisfy a given predicate. The more worker votes that are required to reach a convincing consensus about whether an item satisfies a predicate, the more ambiguous it is.
\item {\bfseries{cost\+:}} A metric of predicates that considers both the number of tasks they tend to require to pass or fail an item (i.\+e. ambiguity) and {\itshape also} the amount of clock time required for workers to return a response for an IP pair for that predicate.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_consensus}{}\section{Aggregating Worker Votes \& Evaluating Consensus}\label{index_consensus}
Our consensus metric is complicated. For each IP pair chosen, we do the following\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We gather (\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacedynamicfilterapp_1_1toggles_a157bc167f366f75c9ba8d3e36e8d8540}{N\+U\+M\+\_\+\+C\+E\+R\+T\+A\+I\+N\+\_\+\+V\+O\+T\+ES}}) votes on the chosen IP pair
\item To take \char`\"{}consensus\char`\"{} we generate a beta distribution from the number of (y/n) votes
\item Then integrate over it from zero to (\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacedynamicfilterapp_1_1toggles_ac4442b6c569574253ef445d09952d3f0}{D\+E\+C\+I\+S\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+T\+H\+R\+E\+S\+H\+O\+LD}})
\item If the probability area is less than (\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacedynamicfilterapp_1_1toggles_aaefdc27b85545eb4a910f5c65f7d8bbb}{U\+N\+C\+E\+R\+T\+A\+I\+N\+T\+Y\+\_\+\+T\+H\+R\+E\+S\+H\+O\+LD}}) then we have consensus
\item Else we gather more votes
\end{DoxyItemize}

This is repeated until one of several conditions is met\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item We reach consensus (naturally)
\item The total number of gathered votes is equal to (\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacedynamicfilterapp_1_1toggles_a914791c176a78c026dc76a18bcd88d73}{C\+U\+T\+\_\+\+O\+FF}})
\item The number of either (yes)s or (no)s on their own is equal to (\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacedynamicfilterapp_1_1toggles_afa8e106b735033b706b1412e12f6783b}{S\+I\+N\+G\+L\+E\+\_\+\+V\+O\+T\+E\+\_\+\+C\+U\+T\+O\+FF}})
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

If either condition 2 or 3 we take a simple majority vote.\hypertarget{index_current}{}\section{Current Work}\label{index_current}
