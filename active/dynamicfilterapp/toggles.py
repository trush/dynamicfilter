####################### CONFIGURING CONSENSUS ##############################
# This desc. is old and some of the variable names may no longer match, but the
# algorithm described is still the same
    # Our consensus metric is Complicated. For each IP pair chosen, we do the following
    # We gather (NUM_CERTAIN_VOTES) votes on the chosen IP pair
    # To take "consensus" we generate a beta distribution from the number of (y/n) votes
    #   then intigrate over it from zero to (DECISION_THRESHOLD)
    #   if the probability area is less than (UNCERTAINTY_THRESHOLD) then we have consensus
    #   else we gather more votes
    # This is repeated until one of several conditions is met
    #   1 - We reach consensus (naturally(Bayes))
    #   2 - The total number of gathered votes is equal to (CUT_OFF)
    #   3 - The number of either (yes)s or (no)s on their own is equal to (SINGLE_VOTE_CUTOFF)
    # If either cond. (2|3) we take a simple majority vote

##General Consensus
NUM_CERTAIN_VOTES = 5   # number of votes to gather no matter the results
                        # higher values leave consensus less vulnerable to initial randomness
                        # Should never go below 3 (5 is really low anyway)
                        # Recomended val: 5 (unless using agressive bayes)
##VoteCutOff
CUT_OFF = 21    # Maximum number of votes to ask for before using Majority Vote as backup metric
                # Only rather ambiguous IP pairs should ever actually reach this limit
                # Recomended value (21 for real data) #TODO test more stuff on synth data
SINGLE_VOTE_CUTOFF = int(1+math.ceil(CUT_OFF/2.0))  # Number of votes for a single result (Y/N) before calling that the winner #TODO remove this!
                                                    # This should be depricated soon
                                                    # if you're reading this, Jake forgot to take this variable out or was lazy

##Bayes:
    # The Bayes portion of the alg is weird and bayesian
    # we assume no prior knowledge of the IP pair and thus that there is an
    # even likelyhood of it being either true or false.
    # In the bayesian world we represent everything as a distribution of probability.
    # We use a beta-distribution [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution]
    # to represent the distribution of our probability. the beta-distribution has two
    # parameters which govern its shape, (a&b). we start with both at 1 which is a
    # uniform flat distribution. These a and b represent the number of votes for either
    # yes or no on a given IP pair where their values should always be 1 more than the
    # number of votes for each catagory. To take consensus, we build our distribution
    # and integrate over it from zero to DECISION_THRESHOLD. If the total area in that
    # area is less than the UNCERTAINTY_THRESHOLD, we have reached consensus.
    # The motivation is this. The integration is asking the question:
    # "With the data we have right now, what's the probability that the true [...]
    # probability is between 0 and (e.g.) 0.5." (Our IP pair has some true ratio of
    # yes votes to no votes.) If the probability of the ratio being within that range
    # is small enough, (smaller than UNCERTAINTY_THRESHOLD) we can conclude that the
    # true ratio must be larger than that. If the probability is low enough, and the
    # DECISION_THRESHOLD chosen correctly, we can say that we have determined the
    # ratio, and thus know the "true" answer to our question.
BAYES_ENABLED = False           # Should we even use bayes at all?

UNCERTAINTY_THRESHOLD = 0.05    # maximum acceptable proability area
                                # how likely to be wrong we're ok with being

                                # (how significant the ratio must be)
FALSE_THRESHOLD = 0.05          # Used for ALMOST_FALSE TODO better docs

##Adaptive Consensus
    # Our algorithm can attempt to "Learn" what a good consensus alg. looks like
